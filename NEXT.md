# Cosmos — state

READ `SPEC.md` FIRST (game, model, engine decisions, round-1 work packages). This file = what is running now.

## 06/10 night
- Old web project E:\CosmosSandbox = ARCHIVED (reference only, nothing deleted; note at top of its ROADMAP.md).
- master: object model core + Sol scene + window (top-down default). Checks green: merge, moon (472 turns), sol (1.36% drift), constants (G 1→2), repeat.
- Yang has NOT yet seen the object-model window (`run.bat`). `_Draw` + mouse paths never ran headless → first thing to ask him.
- Round 1 handed out on bridge thread `cosmos` (SPEC §6): P1 Celine `E:\Cosmos-celine` celine/rules · P2 Ariel `E:\Cosmos-ariel` ariel/godtools · P3 Selica `E:\Cosmos-selica` selica/audit. Agents wake only when Yang prompts them.
- Claire next: review + merge reports; fast-forward on rails (SPEC §4 OPEN); collect Yang's content for rules 2-4 (life/civ parameters, thresholds).

## Lessons (process)
- Yang explaining an idea over several messages = listen only; build on his explicit go. (06/10: core rewritten mid-explanation, Yang objected; commit f0817b1 kept because it matched.)
- Smallest playable slice before infrastructure.

## Traps
- `dotnet new sln` on SDK 10 writes `.slnx`; Godot needs `game/Cosmos.Game.sln` (`--format sln`).
- `\n` typed inside a Bash tool command reaches python/sed as a real newline → C# strings with escapes go through Write/Edit.
- cli full run ≈ 1.5 min: default 2 min tool timeout is too tight.
